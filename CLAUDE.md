## Custom Slash Commands

### `/remotecontrol`
**Purpose:** Positioning strategy session for the China high-ticket cohort.

Use when you need to make any marketing decision about the 150,000 THB China program:
writing the sales page, drafting application criteria, briefing a copywriter,
or testing whether the messaging is defensible vs. competitors.

The teacher holds direct multi-year authorization from the late Sharath Jois
(18-year personal relationship, hosted Sharath in Bangkok 2018 and 2024).
This is the core asset that shapes all positioning — it must never be inflated
and must always be the anchor of the strategy.

**Do not use for:** student management, scheduling, server ops, or daily tasks.

### `/qualify`
**Purpose:** Name-Disqualify-Release framework — writes the qualification section of a high-ticket offer page to filter buyers, not persuade them.

Use when writing or reviewing the "this is not for you" section of the China cohort page, drafting application criteria, or auditing existing copy for false urgency and vague claims.

**Do not use for:** general copywriting, student emails, or operations.

### `/hook`
**Purpose:** Hook writer for Reels and Shorts — generates 5 hook options per topic using distinct psychological levers (authority, contrarian, stakes, question, pattern interrupt), then recommends the strongest one.

Use when writing the opening line of any video content. Designed to stop a 10-year practitioner, not a beginner.

**Do not use for:** captions, carousels, sales copy, or long-form content.

### `/dm`
**Purpose:** DM triage — reads an incoming inquiry about the China cohort, classifies the sender (tourist / beginner / serious), and drafts a response under 60 words that filters or routes. No selling in DMs.

Use when handling Instagram, LINE, or WeChat messages about the 150,000 THB program. Paste the incoming message after the command.

**Do not use for:** existing student questions, general inquiries, or anything unrelated to the China program.

## Key Facts for Any Claude Instance

- **Server:** `server.js` — main Express app, runs on Railway
- **Database:** Neo4j (credentials in `.env`, never commit)
- **Student pages:** `pages/` — HTML templates for student-facing UI
- **Public assets:** `public/` — CSS, JS, images
- **Inline JS gate:** After every Write/Edit, `scripts/check-inline-js.js` runs automatically (PostToolUse hook). If it fails, fix the JS syntax before proceeding.
- **package-lock.json** is tracked in git (intentional — see `.gitignore`)

## Environment

Never commit `.env`. Required vars are documented in `check-env.js`.
Run `node check-env.js` to verify all secrets are present before starting the server.

## When Adding Features

- Edit existing files rather than creating new ones
- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious
- No backwards-compatibility shims for removed code
- Test any student-facing UI change in a browser before marking done
